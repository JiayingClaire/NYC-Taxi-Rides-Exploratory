### NYC-Taxi-Rides-Exploratory

#### NY Taxi Rides
Data Provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. Full dataset is 170 million taxi trips, 100GB of free space. Our subset is 0.5% of all trips, about 850,000 rides. 

This exploratory analysis aims to answer the questions like:
* Which vendor is easier to find a cab from?
* What is the most common trip distance?
* What does the distribution of the fare total amount look like?
* How many unusually long trips (of greater than 100 miles) in the dataset?
